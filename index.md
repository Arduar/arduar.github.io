Sanctuary of St. Raphel,
Vann, In the Urartian Highlands

Father Domas, Urartian Judge, and Father Timothy, Urartian Decon begin a sacred liturgical ritual for a congreation of two hundred.

Cool effect: The first letter of the body is larger, and in a more fancy script, ala storybook style. 

Body: 

DEACON: Master, late is the hour. 

PRIEST: What hour is it?

DEACON: Eight hours past noon.

PRIEST: Then let us begin!

Blessed are the halls of the One-Above-All, blessed is the divine lady, Jabrah, who delivered the world from darkness! Blessed those whose heart remains loyal to the One-Above-All, now and forever, and to the ages of ages!

ALL: Amen; Amen!

DEACON: In peace, let us pray to the One-Above-All!
Let us pray for true peace, only like the peace from above, and for the rescue of all in darkness!
Let us pray for this peace throughout the entire world! 
Let us pray for calm winds and fertile soil.
Let us pray for refreshing rains and warm seasons. 
Let us pray for deliverance from afflictions; both of heart and body.

Help us, o mightiest, your flawed and many children, have mercy on us for our faults, and shield us with your light.

ALL: Lord, have mercy!

DEACON: Master, arise!

(The priest rises from his seat, where he was once sitting in contemplation of the lesson he is to impart. He carries a black cloth, needle, and thread)

PRIEST: Peace be to all of you!

CONGREGATION: And to you, father!

PRIEST: It is written that before all ages, there was a great darkness. Darker than the sky above our sanctuary, for there was no starlight. 
Within this darkness, a voice, glorious and powerful, spoke "Let it begin!"

ALL: Lord of Glory!

PRIEST: When these words shattered the darkness, a place of golden light emerged in the void, and sitting upon a white throne, more pristine than uncut marble, was The-One-Above-All. No words in the tongues of Men, Raksha, or Medorians can describe the unimaginable, blinding glory of he who sat on the throne!

ALL: Lord of Light!

PRIEST: And with him were the Jinn, the first children of the One-Above-All; countless numbers, but even their numbers made the golden halls feel wide and tall, so is the glory of The-One-Above-All.

DEACON: Master, of nothing were these beings born?

PRIEST: No!

(Congregation slams their stave butts upon the floor three times)

PRIEST: Each of them is a weaving of the void by the One-Above-All, his thread the water of life, which is the province of he alone!

ALL: Lord of Life!

PRIEST: First among the Jinn was Konstanyan. His glory was great, and his voice so beautiful, it drew tears from stone. The One-Above-All weaved him of gold and violet; his face was noble, hair polished brass, and wings of violet and indigo. Of all the Jinn, Konstanyan's portion of power was the greatest, and he was the most fair. When he first saw his father, Konstanyan fell to his knees in songs of praise, and thus, Konstanyan's province was song.

All: Mightiest and First!

PRIEST: The Numbers of the Jinn are without count; the first children of the One-Above-All were diverse. Michah, who was quick to smile at all times, had skin the color of moist mud, with hair of coal, eyes of gold, and wings more blue than a summer sky. Michah was an inquisitive creature, and so his province became sorcery and the management of the weavings of the One-Above-All. Lammashil was imposing. Her skin was ivory, like a porcelain doll. Her eyes and hair were dark black, and her wings were a shadowed silver. Her keen focus and vigilance made loyalty her province. The meekest among them, for whom tears and mercy became province, was Jabrah.

All: Jabrah! The most blessed! Our lady clothed in brown!

CHORUS: Quiet and plain, whose voice is a whisper, whose song is weeping;
we, flawed children, deserve not your witness, your pleas for mercy.
Each tear you shed is our salvation; you shall find your courage in your compassion!

PRIEST: Jabrah was smaller than most Jinn. Her wings resembled those of a brown hawk, her hair was the color of wheat, and her large, meek eyes were roasted chestnuts. Jinn, beings of free will, like us, know failings of pride. Jabrah knew not pride. 

All: From the meekest, shall be crowned Queen of Kings!

(during the recitation of the congregation, the Priest begins to draw a single strand of gold across the black cloth)

PRIEST: And so it came to be, that the One-Above-All asked the Jinn to weave the void with him, that they can share in the creation of something beautiful. It was not known to the Jinn at that time, that the water of life was passed through them, and their weavings would become divine!

All: Praise be to the One-Above-All, glorious, but wise - that his children weave with him!

PRIEST: So deep for the One-Above-All was the love held in Konstanyan's heart, it clouded his mind from understanding the purpose of his Father's mind. He set about to create a monument to his Father's glory, and when one of his brothers and sisters looked away, he would clip their weave to make space for more of his own!

ALL: Repent, son of the Greatest!

PRIEST: But he did not repent. He continued, until most of the creation was his own weave upon the stars! He presented it to the One-Above-All, hoping for his adoration.  

But instead, he was chastised;

"My son, know not that you are my creation? That all glory you direct to yourself serves in my own? Know that these are not also my children, and you serve nothing when interrupting their glory, but to hurt them?"

All: Lord have mercy!

DEACON: Master, did Konstanyan repent?

(Congregation slams their staves to the floor three times)

PRIEST: No! He spoke of repentance, but in his heart, he let his sin whisper to him. "See how he chastises you, when your offering was the greatest? He does not love you."

DEACON: Master! Did Konstanyan speak this fear to our Lord?

(Again, the congregation slams their staves to the floor three times)

PRIEST: No!

Such is the nature of sin; it craves more and can never be fed. It is a poison, not merely darkness.

All: Lord have mercy upon the first, even now, may he know he is loved!

PRIEST: Lammashil noticed her elder brother's tears, which he hid from all else, and she comforted him, and her intent to give him comfort fed his sin;

"My brother, your contribution was truly the most beautiful. Surely, our Father recognizes this, and will recognize this when the peace is done." It was true; the One-Above-All kept the discord of Konstanyan upon the sky, but he joined in the weaving himself. Konstanyan chastised, the one above all weaved with the water of life, and connected threads of the many other Jinn to, and through the discord of Konstanyan. 

(the Priest continues to weave during this passage. the single stroke is changed by further weaving into an icon of Jabra's holy staff, and symbol of the Church, Rah)

DEACON: Behold! All that there is!

(As the priest finishes his simple tapestry, the altar boys and girls of the church pull fabric blocking the central glass dome of the sanctuary, which floats to the ground. the planetary rings of Arduar, as well as the stars, are lit by its axial tilt during this season; the sky above is truly breathtaking)

CONGREGATION (Falling to their knees) Glorious is our Lord! Have mercy upon your flawed children!

PRIEST: Rise, my brothers and sisters.

(The congregation rises and grips their staves again.)

PRIEST: The One-Above-All knew the storm in Konstanyan's heart, and reached out to him again; but not with false comfort, but the comforting, just wisdom of a loving father.

"Konstanyan, First of my children are you, and the greatest portion of my glory is apportioned you. You are truly the fairest and most passionate of my children. Do not despair. Look upon all that there is, and how I have weaved your offering together with all of them, for the greater glory of all. Your discord has been changed into a story more beautiful for it having been part of it."

ALL: Repent!

DEACON: Master, Did Konstanyan repent?

(The Congregation gently taps the ground with their staves three times)

PRIEST: (does not shout this time) No. The sin in his heart, and the growing sin of Lammashil's heart conspired to twist the wisdom of their Father as mockery. 

ALL: Oh, lost thread, a place for you remains in the tapestry! Return! Its weaver weeps for you.

PRIEST: The One-Above-All gathered all of his first children and again spoke to them, of a choice.

"Know that I have used the water of life to trace your work, and that it is alive."

He revealed to them the cosmos from the golden halls, and many fell to their knees in wonder. Each thread they had drawn - a star, a world of storms, a cloud of dust reflecting a rainbow of lights. The discord of Konstanyan was truly remarkable, a dominating wall of clusters of billions of stars, blinding in its glory!

"My Children, now I reveal to you the purpose of our work. 
Only the creators experience this place; it Is my design that it be experienced from within. 

I offer to each of you the opportunity to descend to world Arduar, one of beauty within the Wall of stars; to be born as beings of flesh. Know that this will make you forget these halls for a time; and there is the danger that the hardships of life will drive you away from me if you allow sin to fester within you.

To those who take not this opportunity, I offer the option to dwell in the world unseen to creatures of flesh, there to manage the world through the threads unseen, upon the back of our tapestry. 

To the remaining, I offer that you stay with me in the Golden Halls, and observe as our creation comes to know itself."

ALL: Each of us, Man, Medorian, and Raksha being among the first portion!

PRIEST: And so, Michah and many of his closest allies descended into the world unseen, for they longed for adventure but knew well the mind of their Father. The host which descended to the world as flesh is unknown, but all of us here are a part of this host, and it is said we are among the most bold. Jabrah, and many of the most meek stayed in the golden halls, to stay close to their Father for all ages. 

DEACON: What of the lost? What of Konstanyan and Lammashil?

PRIEST: They fled into the void, to make mischief of it, and claim it was of Konstanyan's creation. Many sorrows followed, for many years, but that is a tale for another time.

DEACON: Master, will you join us in the hall of fellowship, and break bread this evening?

PRIEST: I shall, but first, to all who long for absolution, come to me, and I will intercede with our Lord.

(The CHORUS begins chanting the Hymn of the Meekest and the Most Blessed, and the congregation begins to exit, to take part in the Festival of lights, in the hall of fellowship within the sanctuary)

CHORUS: Meekest of the first-born, dove of mercy!
Your tears are our salvation, your whispers our commandments!
We are the threads cut and resewn, we scatter by our failures
Weave us home, oh gentlest, weave us home!
In the halls of golden light, your mercy speaks to our creator!
When we walked through darkness of the enemy, you showed us light!
We are the threads cut and resewn, we scatter by our failures
Weave us home, oh gentlest, weave us home!

(repeat the final line, as the congregation exits)
